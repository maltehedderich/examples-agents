## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

This project demonstrates prompt chaining, a workflow that decomposes a complex task into a sequence of steps. Each step involves an LLM call that processes the output from the previous step.

This workflow is particularly useful when a task can be easily divided into distinct subtasks. The primary advantage is improved accuracy, achieved by breaking down a complex task into smaller, more manageable LLM calls, trading off latency.

As example we will build a simple workflow that reviews legal documents. The workflow will consist of the following steps:

- Clause Identification: Identifies and extracts key clauses (e.g., liability, termination, payment) from the legal document.
- Risk Assessment: Assesses the risk associated with each clause, identifying potential legal issues and recommending mitigation strategies.
- Summarization: Creates a summary of the document, highlighting the key clauses and associated risks.
- Red Flag Generation: Generates a list of potential issues or "red flags" in the document, focusing on areas of high risk.
